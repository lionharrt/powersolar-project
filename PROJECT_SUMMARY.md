## 🔑 Key Differentiators from Emteknik

### Business Focus
- **Emteknik**: Turkish industrial construction (steel, roofing, facade)
- **Power Solar**: Irish residential/commercial solar PV installation

### Technical Differences
1. **Database Schema**: Solar-specific fields (roof orientation, kWh usage, SEAI grants)
2. **Form Fields**: Eircode, property types, electricity usage, system sizes
3. **Grant System**: Ireland SEAI grants vs Turkey grants
4. **Terminology**: kWp, kWh, BER (Ireland-specific)
5. **Service Areas**: Dublin & Leinster vs Bursa, Turkey
6. **Language**: English only vs Turkish/English/Multiple

### No Code Duplication
- All components rewritten from scratch
- No emteknik artifacts in codebase
- Different naming conventions (PowerSolar* vs Section*)
- Solar industry-specific terminology throughout
- Ireland business context throughout

## 📝 Final Notes

This project has been scaffolded within the emteknik-project directory for convenience during development, allowing easy reference to similar architectural patterns. It is **fully independent** and ready to be:

1. Extracted to its own repository
2. Set up with independent version control
3. Deployed to its own infrastructure
4. Developed further with Power Solar-specific features

The foundation is solid. The next phase is content creation, feature completion, and deployment.

**Project Created**: 2024
**Framework**: NestJS + React
**Language**: TypeScript
**Target Market**: Ireland (Dublin & Leinster)
**Business**: Solar PV Installation
