- **Content**: Update all JSON files in `src/locales/en/`
- **Sections**: Add/remove/modify in `src/variants/`

## ⚠️ Known Adaptations Needed

The template has been copied from Power Solar and made generic, but you may need to:

1. **Update Section Names** (if you want different names)
   - Currently: `whoWeAre`, `benefits`, `services`, `showcase`, `process`, `didYouKnow`, `invest`, `contact`
   - You can rename to: `hero`, `about`, `features`, `portfolio`, `testimonials`, etc.
   - Update in: `src/contexts/VariantContext.tsx` and `src/config/variants.ts`

2. **Remove Power Solar References** (if any remain)
   - Search for "Solar", "Power", "Brendan" in all files
   - Replace with your own content

3. **Add Your Assets**
   - Logo: Place in `public/logo.png`
   - Images: Add to `public/images/`
   - Videos: Add to `public/videos/`
   - Update references in variant files

4. **Customize i18n Content**
   - All files in `src/locales/en/` have generic placeholders
   - Replace with your actual content

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Use Dev Toolbar for Client Demos**
   - Open site with `?devmode=true` in production
   - Let clients choose themes/layouts in real-time
   - Apply their selections to code afterwards

2. **Start with One Section**
   - Customize one section completely before moving to the next
   - Test thoroughly on mobile and desktop
   - Use variant system to A/B test layouts

3. **Theme First, Then Variants**
   - Choose your final theme first
   - Then customize section variants for that theme
   - Ensures visual consistency

4. **Keep Variants Simple**
   - Don't overcomplicate layouts
   - 3 good variants > 10 mediocre ones
   - Test with real content before finalizing
