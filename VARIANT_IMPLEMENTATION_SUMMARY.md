## **üé® Design System**

### **Placeholder Patterns**
All placeholders follow consistent design language:
- **Team photos**: Gradient from `primary-400` to `primary-600` with group icon

- **Project photos**: Various gradients (`primary`, `secondary`, `accent`) with image icon
- **Video**: Gradient with play button overlay + timeline UI
- **Logos**: Gray gradient with badge icon

### **Color Usage**
- Primary: Main brand actions, trust elements
- Secondary: Alternative CTAs, featured items
- Accent: Highlights, badges, special callouts
- Gradients: All placeholders use subtle gradients for depth
